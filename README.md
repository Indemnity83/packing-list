packing-list
============

An MIT Licensed Vacation &amp; Trip Packing List.

I use this for <10 day trips. I improve it everytime I miss something abroad, so it evolves.

Next trip, I print this out and just check items off with a pen.

Makes the process of packing pretty efficient. Some items don't always apply
but it's nice to be sure I didn't miss anything.
